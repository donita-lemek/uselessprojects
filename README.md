# Verbal Roast ðŸŽ¯

## Basic Details

**Developer:** Donita Lemek â€” Mar Athanasius College of Engineering, Kothamangalam

---

## Project Description

Verbal Roast takes a video input from the user, analyzes the spoken words to find the most frequently used ones, and then humorously roasts the user for overusing those words.

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People often don't realize how repetitive they sound â€” but wouldnâ€™t it be hilarious if an app called them out for it?

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Verbal Roast listens to your speech, finds your verbal quirks, and throws witty roasts your way for using the same words too much!
