- Word Frequency List: Display a ranked list of the most frequent words in the video transcript, along with their respective counts.
- AI Roast Generation: Use OpenAI to generate a roast based on the most frequently used word identified in the video transcript. This tool decides the most impactful information to make the roast cutting, concise, and humorous.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) to support a dark mode theme.
- Primary color: Fiery red (#FF4500) for accents and interactive elements, symbolizing the 'roast' aspect.
- Accent color: Light orange (#FFA500) as a complementary color to the primary red, enhancing the fiery theme.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, combined with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to maintain readability in longer text sections.
- Use sharp, edgy icons with red accents to align with the fiery theme.
- Incorporate subtle fade-in and slide-in animations to create smooth transitions between screens and when revealing generated roasts.
